 * The doorway.
 *
 * There are two gardens, and they are not the same kind of object.
 * Vanaspati we drew: the medicine organises the ground, and it exists
 * here and nowhere else. Vanaspatyam is a real garden in Sion with an
 * address, a dispensary attached and ten thousand plants in it, and
 * what you walk here is our reconstruction of one plot of it.
 *
 * A visitor arriving cold cannot guess that difference, and getting it
 * wrong in either direction is bad — either the designed garden reads
 * as a claim about a real site, or the real one reads as invented. So
 * each card says which kind it is on its face, and the real one carries
 * enough of the actual place to stand on its own.
