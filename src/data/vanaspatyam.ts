/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * Vanaspatyam — the Ayurvedic medicinal plants' garden at Somaiya,
 * inaugurated 12 February 2016.
 *
 * The bones are the surveyed design: 30 m north-south by 25 m across, a
 * south gate on the axis, a 2.2 m central spine, ranks of beds either
 * side of it, and a circular lily pond closing the north end.
 * The dressing is what the camera found there — red lateritic soil,
 * brick-kerbed beds, white label boards on black posts, a clipped
 * boundary hedge, and the transmission pylons that stand over the whole
 * garden and are the first thing anyone recognises.
 *
 * Everything below is in metres, laid out around the origin:
 *   +X east, -Z north (so the gate sits at +Z), Y up.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ */

/* The plan gives 30 m by 25 m, a 2.2 m spine, 1.3–1.5 m cross paths,
 * 3–4 m beds and a 6–7 m pond. Those are constraints rather than
 * coordinates, so the positions below are derived from them and checked
 * against each other — the first attempt at this put the pond's walking
 * ring straight through the back rank of beds. */
/* Five ranks rather than the plan's four. The plan's sixteen beds meant
 * three species crowded into some of them, standing close enough to grow
 * through each other and to need three labels on one bed's edge. A fifth
 * rank buys four more beds, which is enough to hold every bed to one or
 * two species — slightly shallower beds and tighter cross paths pay for
 * most of the extra length. */
