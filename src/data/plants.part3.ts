    tagline: '“That which renews” — a monsoon weed that resurrects itself and reduces swelling.',
    description:
      'Punarnava means "renewed again", and the name is literal: the plant dies back to its root in the dry season and springs to life with the first rains, which also gives it the epithet varshabhu, "born of the rains". Therapeutically it is India’s principal diuretic and anti-oedema herb, used for fluid retention, kidney disease and ascites, and its root is a standard component of formulations for swelling of any origin.',
    habitat:
      'A common weed of waste ground, roadsides, field bunds and gardens throughout India up to 2,000 m, most abundant during and after the monsoon.',
    morphology:
      'A prostrate or spreading perennial herb with a stout fusiform root and slender purplish-green stems 30–100 cm long, swollen at the nodes. Leaves are opposite and unequal in each pair, broadly ovate, 2–4 cm, green above and whitish beneath. Tiny pink to magenta flowers appear in small umbellate clusters on long stalks; fruit is a sticky, glandular, ribbed achene that clings to clothing.',
