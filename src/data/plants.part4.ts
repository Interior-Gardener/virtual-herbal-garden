    description:
      'Jaswand is the red flower laid before Kali and Ganesha, and the same flower is boiled in coconut oil in every second household of Kerala and Tamil Nadu for the hair. Its mucilage conditions and its mild acidity closes the cuticle, which is why the oil and the leaf-slip have outlasted every fashion in shampoo. Classical practice also uses the flower for the heart and for menstrual complaints.',
    habitat:
      'Probably of East Asian origin and now grown everywhere in India below 1,200 m, in gardens, hedges and temple grounds. Flowers nearly year-round in the warm south.',
    morphology:
      'A glabrous evergreen shrub 2–4 m tall. Leaves are alternate, broadly ovate, coarsely toothed toward the tip, glossy dark green. Flowers are solitary, axillary, 8–12 cm across, typically crimson, with the staminal column projecting well beyond the petals — the feature that makes the family unmistakable.',
